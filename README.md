# Claude Engineer v3 🤖

A powerful self-improving AI Assistant designed for creating and managing AI tools with Claude 3.5. This framework enables Claude to generate and manage its own tools, continuously expanding its capabilities through conversation. Available both as a CLI and a modern web interface!

## History and Evolution
This project represents the third major iteration of Claude Engineer, building upon the success of Claude Engineer v2. Key improvements from previous versions include:
- Upgraded to Claude 3.5 Sonnet model
- Enhanced token management with Anthropic's new token counting API
- Self-improving tool creation system
- Streamlined conversation handling
- More precise token usage tracking and visualization
- Autonomous tool generation capabilities
- No need for automode since Claude can intelligently decide when to run tools automatically and sequentially.

## Description
Claude Engineer v3 is a sophisticated framework that allows Claude to expand its own capabilities through dynamic tool creation. During conversations, Claude can identify needs for new tools, design them, and implement them automatically. This self-improving architecture means the framework becomes more powerful the more you use it.

    TOOL_USAGE = """
    When using tools, please follow these guidelines:
    1. Think carefully about which tool is appropriate for the task
    2. Only use tools when necessary
    3. Ask for clarification if required parameters are missing
    4. Explain your choices and results in a natural way
    5. Available tools and their use cases
    6. Chain multiple tools together to achieve complex goals:
       - Break down the goal into logical steps
       - Use tools sequentially to complete each step
       - Pass outputs from one tool as inputs to the next
       - Continue running tools until the full goal is achieved
       - Provide clear updates on progress through the chain
    7. Available tools and their use cases
       - BrowserTool: Opens URLs in system's default browser
       - CreateFoldersTool: Creates new folders and nested directories
       - DiffEditorTool: Performs precise text replacements in files
       - DuckDuckGoTool: Performs web searches using DuckDuckGo
       - Explorer: Enhanced file/directory management (list, create, delete, move, search)
       - FileContentReaderTool: Reads content from multiple files\
       - FileCreatorTool: Creates new files with specified content
       - FileEditTool: Edits existing file contents
       - GitOperationsTool: Handles Git operations (clone, commit, push, etc.)
       - LintingTool: Lints Python code using Ruff
       - SequentialThinkingTool: Helps break down complex problems into steps
       - ShellTool: Executes shell commands securely
       - ToolCreatorTool: Creates new tool classes based on descriptions
       - UVPackageManager: Manages Python packages using UV
       - WebScraperTool: Extracts content from web pages

    6. Consider creating new tools only when:
       - The requested capability is completely outside existing tools
       - The functionality can't be achieved by combining existing tools
       - The new tool would serve a distinct and reusable purpose
       Do not create new tools if:
       - An existing tool can handle the task, even partially
       - The functionality is too similar to existing tools
       - The tool would be too specific or single-use

   This is just for you if you want to run the main script in a virtual environment rather than in your default one.
   ```
   python -m venv code_execution_env
   source code_execution_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: code_execution_env\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   deactivate
   ```

## 🔧 Virtual Environment Setup

Claude Engineer uses a dedicated virtual environment for code execution to ensure isolation and security. The virtual environment is automatically created the first time you run a piece of code. However, if you want to set it up manually or customize it, follow these steps:

1. Create the virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv code_execution_env
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     code_execution_env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source code_execution_env/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Deactivate the virtual environment when you're done:
   ```
   deactivate
   ```

The code_execution_env virtual environment will be used for all code execution tasks, ensuring a consistent and isolated environment for running user code.
